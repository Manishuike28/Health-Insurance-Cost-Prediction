# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Developed a machine learning solution to estimate health insurance costs based on user demographics and health parameters. The project included data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and GUI deployment.

Processed a dataset with 1,338 rows and 7 features, converting categorical data to numerical values.

Trained and evaluated multiple models, with Gradient Boosting Regressor achieving 87% prediction accuracy (RÂ² = 0.87) and MAE = $2,470.
Visualized actual vs. predicted costs for performance comparison across models.

Built a Tkinter-based GUI for real-time predictions, enhancing user interaction.

Deployed the trained model using joblib, ensuring efficient and reusable predictions.
